```

1.2. For MacOS:

```

1.3. For Windows

* Download MSYS2

>https://www.msys2.org/

Download (for example) in directory: "C:\Programs\msys64\" or "C:\msys64\"

* Add in field "Path" in **Environment variables in Windows** your path "C:\Programs\msys64\mingw64\bin" or "C:\msys64\mingw64\bin"

>If you use x32 bitness arhitecture, use folder *mingw32* and terminal *MinGw32*

* Open **Start menu** and launch **MSYS2 MINGW64**

Input command in terminal MINGW64:

```
pacman -Syu
```

Then for x64:

```
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc
```

For x32:

```
pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-gcc
```

Install make in MSYS2 MINGW64:

```
pacman -S make
```

* Add in field "Path" at **Environment variables in Windows** your path for **make** "C:\Programs\msys64\mingw64\usr\bin" or "C:\msys64\mingw64\usr\bin"

>If you use x32 bitness arhitecture, use folder *mingw32* and terminal *MinGw32*

* If you use VS Code, run VS Code as **administrator**, because compilation with g++ requests access to temporary files in the **Temp** folder if you use **make** in GitBush 

>Unfortunately, I haven't added MSVC and cl compiles yet, but I'm working on this function
